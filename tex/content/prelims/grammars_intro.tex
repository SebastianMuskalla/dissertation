We introduce grammars, a type of language-generating mechanisms whose underlying principle is rewriting.
We consider languages of finite words generated by context-free \nb{grammars (CFGs)}, languages of infinite words generated by CFGs, and languages of finite words generated by higher-order recursion schemes (HORSes).
