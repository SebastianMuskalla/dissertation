We present (labeled) Petri nets, an automaton model that is particularly suitable for modeling concurrent processes.
We study the languages defined by Petri nets and algorithmic techniques for checking properties of these languages.
Finally, we discuss well-structured transition systems, a generalization of Petri nets.

Most of the material can be found in standard textbooks on the topic, \eg~\cite{Reisig85}, and is not a contribution of this thesis.
\cref{Section:PNBPP} contains a minor contribution, it studies the complexity of the word problem for BPP nets.
