The goal of this chapter is to demonstrate that the separator construction outlined in \cref{Chapter:WSTSSeparability} is constructive.
For many types of WSTSes, it is possible to actually construct an invariant in the ideal completion which then can be turned into a separator.
Here, we consider the case of Petri nets with coverability as the acceptance condition.
We show how to construct an NFA whose language is a regular separator with a number of states that is at most triply exponential.
We complement this result by a doubly exponential lower bound.
Unfortunately, the bounds are not tight, a fact on which we will briefly comment later.
