In this chapter, we study the relations among various classes of WSTS languages that are defined by imposing restrictions on the WSTSes.
This correlates with our analysis of separability for WSTS languages, the main goal of this part of the thesis, in the following sense: Many of the results that we will prove in this chapter will widen the applicability of our results on WSTS separability.
We will comment on this in more detail in the next chapter.
