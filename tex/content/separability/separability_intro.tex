In \cref{Section:IntroSeparability}, we have motivated our interest in separability by its potential applications in compositional verification.
In this chapter, which serves as an introduction to this part of the thesis, we will elaborate on the theoretical background of the separability problem.
This includes giving the formal definition.
Afterwards, we discuss some results from the literature that settle the status of decidability of the separability problem for several language classes.
Finally, we outline the results that we will prove in this part of the thesis.
