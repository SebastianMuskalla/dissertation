The goal of this chapter is proving the results that we have outlined in \cref{Separability:Results}.
We will start by formally stating the results and discussing their consequences.
Then, we will prove a technical core theorem from which we can directly conclude our result on the separability of languages of DWSTSes.
Finally, we will introduce ideals and the ideal completion of a WSTS, concepts that will allow us to also apply our core result to upward-compatible WSTSes.
