This chapter serves as an introduction to this part of the thesis.
In \cref{Section:IntroClosures} of the introduction, we have outlined the importance of the set of all superwords and subwords of a language for several verification tasks that deal with systems containing unreliable communication.
In the following, we will give some definitions to make this formal.
Then, we summarize some results from the literature, presenting classes of languages for which these sets have already been shown to be computable.
Finally, we outline the contributions contained in this part of the thesis.
